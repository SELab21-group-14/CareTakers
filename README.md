Hospital Management System

# Project Name: Caretakers


# About: 
"Caretakers" is the website we created for the management of hospital system.
The website is designed to help patients get their appointment for their health and disease related check-up by providing the patients with the details and options of multiple high quality hospitals and doctors,and follow up with every step from appointment to bill payment, receipt generation and also keeping the track of their problems and satisfaction through feedback systems.
Our website is very user friendly and easy to use for all the consumers out there whether the patients, doctors or the hospital admins.
The user can join us by signing up with us when they first visit our website,the process is a very easy yet detailed for the best experience of the users.
Three types of users are to be registered on our website for different jobs first the patients will get their profile ready to get an appointment with a good doctor.Then the doctors will register with us for the patients to reach them either directly or through any hospital.
The third ones are the admins who represent the hospitals and will take the required actions on behalf of the hospital.
After the appointment the patient will get him/herself checked-up and then get their prescription for their health improvement.
Then we will give them the chance to provide us with their valuable feedback and we already provided them with the payment bill.
We have build a great environment with many talented and experienced doctors working at trusted hospitals.
These things lead us to be a great help for people and continue the process of helping and connecting the needed to the resourced ones.
We continue on working at improvement part of the project with the help of the feedbacks.
